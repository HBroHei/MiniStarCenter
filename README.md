# MiniStarCenter
https://www.hbrohei.github.io/MiniStarCenter \
A website aims to provide information, guides and strategies for Mario Party 9.\
This repo hosts the site's source files.
## Soft launch
The website is currently not finished, but I want to get the Mario Party 9 information out there sooner rather than later,
to help some players who cared about playing Mario Party 9 strategically.\
Please expect broken links, unoptimised user interface in the webpage.
