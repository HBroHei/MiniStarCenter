    <ul>
        <li>
            First part: All backwards conveyors are bad for the captain in average, and all forwards conveyors will skip ministars, with the exception being the last 2, where the vice versa is better.<br>
            Counting from the start to the mid-boss:
            <ul>
                <li>1st platform: Skips 6 ministars</li>
                <li>2nd platform: Impossible to be landed on with the happening space on it, as the inital state of the conveyor platform is a green space. Unless a player landed on the 1st platform (which even if they did, it would be impossible to reach this space anyways), it will  be a green space when pass-by.</li>
                <li>3rd platform: Benefits the next player after the captain's turn, with ⅚ chance of getting 3 ministars</li>
                <li>4th platform: Skips 3 ministars, and make the next player more likely to get 5 ministars</li>
                <li>5th platform: Skips 5 ministars</li>
                <li>6th platform: Gain 3 ministars, but also give some chances for opponents to gain up to 8 ministars.</li>
                <li>7th platform: Only move backs some spaces. Gives the next player another chance at the spin space though</li>
                <li>8th platform: Gain 3 ministars, and skips 3 miniztars. It is recommended to use 1-3 / 4-6 dice to land on this happening space. (with probability of only ⅓ hitting the 3 miniztars.) Best case, you gain 3 ministars. Worst case scenario, you missed the happening space, gets 3 miniztars, but still gets to land on a spin space, upping the spin star. The other outcome is guarenteeing other player to get the 3 miniztars, causing no harm to you.</li>
                <li>9th platform: Gain 3 ministars, but skips 5 ministars. Only use special dice to land on this if you want to guarentee you have 3 ministars / next player does not get 5 ministars. (Which is a very rare case in this stage of the game)</li>
                <li>10th platform: Gets 3 miniztars, and move backwards. This might be the worse conveyor platform to land on.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>
                Second area:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Probability of going lower path = 49.4%<br>
                        Probability of going upper path = 50.6%<br>
                        Overall you will very slightly more likely going the upper path.
                    </li>
                    <li>Upper path: Use 4-6 / 1-10 dice if possible to gain more ministars (With the exception of bob-omb, explained below) </li>
                    <li>Lower path: Use special dice accordingly to ensure others are getting miniztars but not you.</li>
                    <li>
                        Conveyor platform: Do not use special dice to land on those except last place (explained below) or the last platform.<br>
                        The last platform can gain you 3 ministars and make the opponent have a high chance of gaining 5 miniztars.<br>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Bob-omb on car:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Ideally you can make sure the bob-omb does not hit you by using special dice.</li>
                            <li>Calculate risk management: If gain > loss, then let it explode</li>
                            <li>Lower path have an extra bob-omb spot. Aim to get there if you are in last to try to sabotage other players.</li>

        <li>Captain's Guide:
            <ul>
                <li>Put the top enemy of yours at the 4th slot.</li>
                <li>Put yourself at the 2nd slot to have the chance of gaining most ministars</li>
